 </p>

 <br>

 ### Project 4 | Three-Tier Distributed Web-Based Application
 <p>
 Problem Description: A Three-Tier Distributed Web-Based Application using servlets running on a Tomcat Server to access MSQL database via JDBC<br>
 APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE: <br>
 Tier 1: [User-Level Front End] Consisting of a HTML landing page to authenticate end users. Handled via servlet in the webapp to validate user entered credentials.
        JSP page that allows client to enter SQL commands into a window and submit to server application. 
        Redirects users to one of three JSP pages: root-level user clients, non-root-level clients, data entry for new records.
<br>
 Tier 2: [Serverlet] Handles the SQL command interface for users 
        Root Level: Implement server-side business logic.
            This logic will increment by 5, the status of a supplier anytime that supplier is involved in the insertion/update of a shipment record in which the quantity is greater than or equal to 100.
        Client level: handle SQL command interface without business logic
        Data Entry level: provide user with four forms for each table in the database
<br>        
 Tier 3: [Back-End] Persistent MySQL database under the control of the MySQL DBMS server. Created and maintained via population script <br>
        <br> Schema: <br>
            suppliers (snum, sname, status, city) //information about suppliers <br>
            parts (pnum, pname, color, weight, city) //information about parts <br>
            jobs (jnum, jname, numworkers, city) //information about jobs <br>
            shipments (snum, pnum, jnum, quantity) //suppliers ship parts to jobs in specific quantities
